# Hammerspoon

My Hammerspoon configuration

Still struggling with the hyper key in combination with spoons,
cannot get the hyperkey working with the spoons.

Create symbolic links in the ~/.hammerspoon directory to the git working directory:

```shell
ln -s /Users/albert/git/github.com/tisgoud/hammerspoon/*.lua ~/.hammerspoon/
```

Spoons are located in the ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons directory

Requirement:
- Download [SpoonInstall](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/Spoons/raw/master/Spoons/SpoonInstall.spoon.zip) and unzip it in the `~/.hammerspoon/Spoons` directory.
